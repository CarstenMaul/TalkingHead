# Parallel Body Animation Implementation

## Overview
This implementation enables body-related animations (✋🤚👋👍👎👌🤷‍♂️🙏👉👈) to play in parallel with speech, allowing for more natural and expressive avatar behavior.

## Key Changes

### 1. Parallel Animation Queues
- **Main Queue** (`animQueue`): Handles face/speech animations, lipsync visemes
- **Gesture Queue** (`gestureQueue`): Handles body movements, hand gestures

### 2. Animation Property Classification
```javascript
// Body-only properties (safe during speech)
bodyOnlyProps: ['gesture', 'bodyRotateX', 'bodyRotateY', 'bodyRotateZ', 'handLeft', 'handRight', 'handFistLeft', 'handFistRight']

// Face-blocking properties (interfere with lipsync)
faceBlockingProps: ['mouth', 'jaw', 'viseme_', 'tongue']  

// Face-safe properties (can coexist with speech)
faceSafeProps: ['eyeContact', 'headMove', 'headRotateX', 'headRotateY', 'headRotateZ', 'pose', 'eyeBlinkLeft', 'eyeBlinkRight']
```

### 3. Animation Splitting
The `splitAnimationTemplate()` function separates emoji animations into:
- **Body components**: Go to gesture queue, play during speech
- **Face components**: Go to main queue, only when not speaking

### 4. New API Methods

#### `playGestureEmoji(emoji)`
Plays gesture emojis immediately in parallel with speech:
```javascript
avatar.playGestureEmoji('👋'); // Wave while speaking
avatar.playGestureEmoji('👍'); // Thumbs up during conversation
```

#### Enhanced `gesture()` method
Now splits emoji gestures automatically between body and face components.

## Supported Body Gestures

| Emoji | Animation | Can Play During Speech |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| ✋🤚👋 | Hand wave | ✅ Yes |
| 👍 | Thumbs up | ✅ Yes |
| 👎 | Thumbs down | ✅ Yes (facial expression queued) |
| 👌 | OK gesture | ✅ Yes |
| 🤷‍♂️ | Shrug | ✅ Yes |
| 🙏 | Prayer/namaste | ✅ Yes (with subtle facial) |
| 👉 | Point right | ✅ Yes |
| 👈 | Point left | ✅ Yes |

## Behavior During Speech

### Before Implementation
- Body gestures would interrupt speech
- Emojis in text would pause lipsync
- Camera would focus for every gesture
- Only one animation type could play at a time

### After Implementation  
- Body gestures play simultaneously with speech
- Lipsync continues uninterrupted
- Facial expressions are queued for after speech
- Natural conversation flow maintained
- Camera focus only for facial expressions

## Usage Examples

```javascript
// Text with gestures - now plays body parts during speech
avatar.speakText("Hello! 👋 Great to see you! 👍");

// Manual gesture during speech
avatar.speakText("I'm explaining something important...");
avatar.playGestureEmoji('👉'); // Points while speaking

// Direct gesture calls
avatar.gesture('🤷‍♂️', 3); // 3 second shrug, can overlap with speech
```

## Technical Details

### Animation Processing
1. **Face Queue**: Processes facial expressions, lipsync visemes, eye movements
2. **Gesture Queue**: Processes body rotations, hand gestures, body poses
3. **Parallel Execution**: Both queues run simultaneously in the animation loop

### Queue Management
- Face-blocking animations are skipped during speech
- Body animations continue regardless of speech state
- Gesture queue cleared independently via `stopGesture()`
- Face queue handles lipsync cleanup via `stopSpeaking()`

### Performance Impact
- Minimal: Same animation processing, just split across two queues
- Memory: Slight increase for gesture queue storage
- Processing: Parallel loops vs single loop (negligible difference)

## Testing
Use `test_parallel_gestures.html` to verify:
1. Gestures during speech
2. Queue independence 
3. Proper animation splitting
4. Real-time queue monitoring
